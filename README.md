# 2021 Rocket Lab ðŸš€

![Windsor High School sophomore Alex Oakley, in black shirt and jeans, launches her rocket during a rocket launch project involving the Robotics Engineering and AP Physics classes at Windsor High School in Windsor Oct. 5, 2021. The project, a collaboration with the University of Colorado Ann and H.J. Smead Aerospace Engineering Sciences department, had students in the Robotics Engineering class build electronic modules to record barometric pressure data and assemble them into the rocketsâ€™ nose cones to collect data for analysis by the AP Physics students.

This lab is a collaboration between the Windsor High School (Colorado) AP Physics and Robotics Engineering classes.  The lab was written by [Matt Rhode](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/matt-rhode) at the University of Colorado in Boulder.  Students in Mr. Ash's AP Physics class predict height of rocket launches based on (not sure what to say here).  Students in Mr. Cline's Robotics Engineering class build the electronics systems and program the Arduino NANO microcontrollers to record altitude data for the flights.  All flights will take place at Windsor High School on October 4th, 2021.
